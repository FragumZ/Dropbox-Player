## Updating Your Fork

Before submitting a pull request, you should ensure that your fork is up to date.  

You may fork the Dropbox Player:  

    git remote add upstream git://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Dropbox-Player.git

The first command is only necessary the first time. If you have issues merging, you will need to get a merge tool such as [P4Merge](http://perforce.com/product/components/perforce_visual_merge_and_diff_tools).  

You can then update the branch:  

    git pull --rebase upstream master
    git push --force origin <branch_name>

Once it is set up, run `git mergetool`. Once all conflicts are fixed, run `git rebase --continue`, and `git push --force origin <branch_name>`.
